# Caravan Insurance Customer Interest Prediction

## Overview

Welcome to the Caravan Insurance Customer Interest Prediction project! This project aims to address the challenge of targeting potential customers effectively for caravan insurance policies through direct mailings. Sending out irrelevant marketing materials not only wastes resources but also contributes to environmental issues. By leveraging data science techniques, we can better understand the target audience and make informed decisions, thus reducing costs and minimizing waste.

## Project Description

In this project, we focus on predicting customer interest in a caravan insurance policy. The dataset contains a variety of variables derived from zip area codes and product usage data, which we will utilize to build a predictive model. The main goal is to determine whether a customer is likely to be interested in purchasing a caravan insurance policy based on their characteristics.

## Dataset

- The dataset comprises 86 variables extracted from zip area codes and product usage data.
- The training set includes more than 5000 customer descriptions, each associated with information about caravan insurance policy ownership.
- The test set includes data for 4000 customers, but the target variable (V86) is not provided for them.
- The task involves creating a CSV file for submission, containing predictions (0 or 1) for the target variable.

## Implementation

We've implemented this project using Python, primarily leveraging the following libraries:

- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models

## Code Walkthrough

```python
# Import necessary libraries and suppress warnings
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load training and test data
datafile_train = 'carvan_train.csv'
datafile_test = 'carvan_test.csv'
cd_train = pd.read_csv(datafile_train)
cd_test = pd.read_csv(datafile_test)

# Check for missing values
cd_train.isnull().sum().sum(), cd_test.isnull().sum().sum()

# Define the target variable
target = 'V86'

# Explore target variable distribution
cd_train[target].value_counts()

# Prepare data for modeling
x_train = cd_train.drop(target, axis=1)
y_train = cd_train[target]

# Import LogisticRegression and define model parameters
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression(fit_intercept=True)
params = {
    'penalty': ['l1', 'l2'],
    'C': np.linspace(0.01, 100, 10),
    'class_weight': ['balanced', None]
}

# Perform GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
gs = GridSearchCV(model, cv=10, param_grid=params, n_jobs=-1, verbose=5, scoring='roc_auc')
gs.fit(x_train, y_train)
best_model = gs.best_estimator_

# Generate prediction probabilities on the training set
train_score = best_model.predict_proba(x_train)[:, 1]
cutoffs = np.linspace(0.001, 0.999, 999)

# Find the optimal cutoff using f-beta score
from sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score
fbetas = []
for cutoff in cutoffs:
    predicted = (train_score > cutoff).astype(int)
    fbetas.append(fbeta_score(y_train, predicted, beta=2))
my_cutoff = cutoffs[fbetas == max(fbetas)]

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = (best_model.predict_proba(cd_test)[:, 1] > my_cutoff).astype(int)
```

## GridSearchCV

### How GridSearchCV Works and How to use it in your project?

GridSearchCV (Grid Search Cross-Validation) is a technique used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data during the training process but are set before training and can have a significant impact on the model's performance. GridSearchCV automates the process of trying out different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the best combination that yields the highest performance according to a chosen evaluation metric.

In your project, you are using GridSearchCV to search through a specified parameter grid and find the best hyperparameters for a logistic regression model. Here's how it works:

1. Define the parameter grid: You define a dictionary (`params`) containing different hyperparameter values that you want to try. In your case, you are trying different penalty types (`'l1'` and `'l2'`), different values of regularization strength (`'C'`), and different options for class weights (`'balanced'` and `None`).

2. Perform cross-validation: GridSearchCV performs k-fold cross-validation (where k is specified by the `cv` parameter) using each combination of hyperparameters. It divides the training data into k subsets (folds) and iteratively trains and evaluates the model on different combinations of training and validation subsets.

3. Evaluate models: For each combination of hyperparameters, the model is trained on k-1 folds and validated on the remaining fold. The chosen evaluation metric (`scoring='roc_auc'` in your case) is used to determine the performance of the model on the validation set.

4. Select the best model: After all combinations have been evaluated, GridSearchCV selects the combination of hyperparameters that resulted in the highest evaluation metric value.

### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a binary classification algorithm commonly used for predicting binary outcomes. It models the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., 0 or 1) based on one or more input features. In your code, you are using the logistic regression algorithm from Scikit-learn.

- `fit_intercept=True`: This parameter specifies whether an intercept term should be included in the model. An intercept is a constant term added to the linear equation that allows the logistic curve to shift along the y-axis.

## Conclusion

GridSearchCV is a powerful tool for finding the best combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. In your project, you're using GridSearchCV to search through different combinations of hyperparameters for a logistic regression model, with the goal of optimizing its performance in predicting customer interest in a caravan insurance policy.

Please note that the explanation provided here is meant to be a high-level overview. The actual implementation and details may vary depending on the specific algorithms and libraries used.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we've explored how data science techniques can be employed to predict customer interest in caravan insurance policies. The goal is to improve marketing strategies by targeting potential customers more effectively, reducing waste and expenses.
